# UX

## Aim of website

The websites goal is to present different options of Kitchen, Bathroom and Bedroom to the user accompanied with a brief description of each option. The layout is designed to be as simplistic as possible, to allow an easy understanding of the site to the user.

## Site creator aim

The aim is to consolidate my brief education in HTML and CSS, showcasing: internal and external links; image and font styling; basic site structure; responsiveness and interactivity; syntax and code structure etc.

## User aim

The user should be able to navigate the site with great ease and understand the variety of options 'home renovations' offers, identifying their different catagorizations and sub-catagories

## Site structure

The site consists of three pages (each clearly denoted by the navigation bars) each page follows a similar structure. The home page contains information needed to understand the site's purpose and how to navigate through it, follwed by the renovations page which is split into 3 sections (kitchen, bathroom and bedroom) these sections contain four sub images that act as an example for the options the user is allowed to choose from. A brief description outlines the various options' benefits and differences. Finally the form page holds the form to be filled out and submitted. In the footer of each page there are links to external social media platforms.

# Testing

* I used chrome developer tools throughout the project to test site responsivity.
* I have opened the site in the following browsers: Fire fox, Chrome and Internet Explorer

## Code Validation

* I ensured that the HTML code was validated using the [w3c code validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
* I ensured that the CSS code was validated using the [jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

## Development Issues

* The first major development issue was with the styling between the text elements and image elements. After a talk with my mentor we came to a solution, which was to wrap each text option and image for that option in the same div, and style the options individually instead of styling the images and the text seperately.

* The second major development issue was a merge bug. I tried to change some of the previous commits I made when updating my readme.md file because they weren't very descriptive, this caused the files to diverge. I incured several other problems while merging the file and re-trying the commit changes, until I took the advice of the code institute tutors to not try something so advanced for my first project which led me to abort the rebase and leave the files merged with the commits unchanged.

# Deployment

The project was deployed on GitHub Pages. I used Gitpod as a development environment and also commited all of the changes to git version control system. I used the push command in Gitpod to save changes to GitHub.

### The deployment process

* Log into Git-hub and select my chosen repository to deploy.
* Go to settings and select Git-hub pages on the left hand side of the page.
* From the source select branch and then main branch.
